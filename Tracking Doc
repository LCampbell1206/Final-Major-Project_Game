***Final Major Project Tracking Document***
In this document, I will include short descriptions of every stage of the development of my FMP game as they are completed.


**Code**
Established gravity in the game, which will ensure the character will fall when not stood on a block.


Game Name - ***Guidance of the Cave***
The game is a simple puzzle platformer set in a cave.
Rather than the player controling the main character, they instead take the role of The Cave.
The player will be able to parts of The Cave to protect and guide the small sheep.

The parts of The Cave the player can move are:
Moss Blocks - controlled by holding 'G' or Triangle, and pressing 'WASD' or The Arrow Buttons to move all blocks in the area.
